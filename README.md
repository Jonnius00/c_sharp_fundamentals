## MoshExercise1_fundamtionals

This repository contains a collection of C# console exercises and solutions, inspired by Mosh Hamedani's C# Fundamentals course. The project is designed for self-study and practice, focusing on core programming concepts using .NET 8.

### Project Structure

- **Conditionals.cs**  
  Practice with conditional statements, including number validation, finding maximum values, image orientation, and speed camera logic.

- **Loops.cs**  
  Exercises on loops, such as counting divisible numbers, summing user input, calculating factorials, guessing games, and finding maximum values in a list.

- **Lists.cs**  
  Tasks involving list manipulation, such as simulating Facebook likes, reversing strings, handling unique numbers, and finding the smallest numbers in a list.

- **Strings.cs**  
  String manipulation exercises, including checking for consecutive numbers, detecting duplicates, validating time formats, converting to PascalCase, and counting vowels.

- **Files_Folders.cs**  
  File I/O exercises, such as reading a text file to count words and find the longest word.

- **Solutions Files**  
  Reference solutions for the above exercises, following best practices and clear structure.

### How to Run

1. **Requirements:**  
   - [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
   - Visual Studio 2022 or later

2. **Build and Run:**  
   - Open the solution in Visual Studio.
   - Set the desired file/class as the startup object (e.g., `Conditionals.Main`).
   - Run the project (F5 or Ctrl+F5).

### Learning Goals

- Practice C# syntax and core programming constructs.
- Develop problem-solving skills with real-world inspired tasks.
- Gain familiarity with .NET 8 and Visual Studio workflow.
- Compare personal solutions with reference implementations.

### Notes

- All exercises are implemented as console applications for simplicity.
- The code is organized for easy navigation and experimentation.
- File paths in file I/O exercises may need adjustment based on your environment.
